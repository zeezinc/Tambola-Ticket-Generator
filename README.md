# Tambola-Ticket-Generator
A Tambola Ticket Generator REST API

Used Java 17, Spring Boot, Hibernate and MYSQL.
Tested using Postman and comitted using TortoiseGit.

Requirements:
Design a Tambola Ticket Generator backend engine with any SQL database.
Although Golang is preferred, but you can use any programming language for this task.
1) Create “N” New Tambola Sets:
1 Tambola set consists of 6 tickets.
Take number of sets (N) as input and generate N new sets of Tambola tickets (i.e. 6N tickets), according to the below rules, and save them in the database.
Tambula Ticket Generator Rules:
●   The numbers 1 to 90 are used once only.
●   In the first column are the numbers 1 to 9, the second column has numbers 10 to 19, etc, all the way to the 9th column which has numbers 80 to 90 in it.
●   Every row must have exactly 5 numbers in it.
Page 2 of 2●   In a specific column, numbers must be arranged in ascending order from top to bottom.
●   Each column must have at least 1 number.
●   All the numbers 1 to 90 are used only once in each set of 6 tickets.
●   Blank Cell fill by zero.
●   Each ticket must be unique and not exist in the database.
Response:
Return the newly created tickets, with table primary-key as JSON key (ex: “12”,”13”,...). Sample Response:

}
}
2) Fetch Saved Tambola Tickets:
Make a GET URL to return the tambola tickets saved in database, with pagination

Attached is a video demonstrating the same.
